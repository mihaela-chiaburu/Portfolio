              <summary>
                I had a university course "Web Technologies", where the professor focused on backend and made us use .NET.
              </summary>
              <div class="why-cs-details">
                <p class="why-cs-p">
                  Honestly, the course was a bit traumatic. The professor was extremely strict, blunt, had a STRONG dislike for frontend developers, and didn‚Äôt tolerate any deviation from his instructions.
                </p> 
                <p class="why-cs-p">But he taught us very solid fundamentals.</p>
                <p class="why-cs-p">Our project was built with sticks and string, but it was the first time I made something that actually worked as a full system, and I was very proud of the architecture I put together. Later, after doing a Java internship, I realized I truly liked C# much more. </p>
                <p class="why-cs-p">Also, I‚Äôve been using Visual Studio for as long as I can remember and it‚Äôs my comfort zone.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>
              At the internship, each team was free to choose the technology they wanted to use for the project.
            </summary>
            I took a risk and suggested .NET, since we had all studied Web Technologies using that framework.
            But my teammates didn‚Äôt even want to hear about it ‚Äî they all decided to go with Java.
            So, I just had to accept my fate and go along with it.

              1. Until I was 13, I thought I‚Äôd become a painter. Then, for the next 3 years, I wanted to be a physicist.
            </summary>
            Somehow, I ended up as a programmer.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>
              2. I started learning programming in 9th grade, chasing the dream of making a game.
            </summary>
            I searched ‚Äúhow to make a game‚Äù on YouTube and unknowingly started learning C# for Unity.
            Later, I gave that up to study Pascal and C++ for school competitions and university classes.
            But life somehow brought me back to C#. I guess it was meant to be.
          </details>

            <summary>
              3. I‚Äôve been studying French for 13 years and I still don‚Äôt speak it.
            </summary>
            I hate French ü•Ä. I studied it in school, then again in university.
            It feels like a burden‚Ä¶ but somehow life keeps tying me to this language.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>
              4. I‚Äôm learning Chinese and I genuinely enjoy Chinese culture and memes, not in a weeb way.
            </summary>
            It‚Äôs more of a chill hobby that I study in a relaxed way.
